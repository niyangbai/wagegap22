# Does the minimum wage reduce the ethnic wage gap?
Often, income inequality exists across ethnical groups. Minimum wages have long been seen as an important part of public policy to deal with poverty and this kind of inequality. Opinions are varied on whether the minimum wage actually reduces income inequality between races. On the one hand, people believe raising the minimum wage will increase the income of workers in low-income groups, thereby reducing some inequality. On the other hand, there are evidences show the rise in minimum wage can lead to higher unemployment, and thus increase inequality among ethnical groups. In this project, I want to verify whether the minimum wage reduces the income gap between races.
